- **Discover degree requirements & resources**  
  Gain equitable access to clear, up-to-date academic pathways, tutoring, advising, and campus support services.
- **Capture personal preferences** (MBTI, priorities, goals)  
  Ensure each student's unique strengths, values, and aspirations are heard and centered.
- **Receive tailored career recommendations**  
  Connect students to meaningful, sustainable career paths that align with both their skills and the needs of society.
- **Generate step-by-step development plans**  
  Provide actionable roadmapsâ€”including coursework, internships, skills workshops, and well-being check-insâ€”to help every student thrive.
