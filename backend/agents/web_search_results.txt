# Computer Science at Stanford University: Academic Pathways & Resources

## Degree Requirements

### Core Requirements
Stanford's CS program (within the School of Engineering) requires:

- **Math**: CS 103, CS 109, MATH 51
- **Science**: 11 units (PHYSICS 41, 43 common choices)
- **Technology in Society**: CS 182, CS 181, CS 182W
- **Engineering Fundamentals**: CS 106B or 106X
- **Writing**: PWR 1 and PWR 2, plus a Writing in the Major course

### CS Core (26 units)
- CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing
- CS 107: Computer Organization & Systems
- CS 109: Probability for Computer Scientists
- CS 110: Principles of Computer Systems
- CS 111: Operating Systems Principles
- CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### Track Requirements
You must complete one of these specialization tracks (20+ units):

- Artificial Intelligence
- Biocomputation
- Computer Engineering
- Graphics
- Human-Computer Interaction
